### SELECT statements


#### Terminology
- The output of a SELECT statement is called results or **a result set** as itâ€™s a set of data that results from a query.
- SELECT * - referred to as a  'select star statement'



#### The following is prudent way structuring a select query
Case insensitive so caps is not necessary but multiple lines helps to avoid errors and provide query clarity through conventional and consistent formatting

```
SELECT 
    lastname, 
    firstname, 
    jobtitle
FROM
    employees;
```
